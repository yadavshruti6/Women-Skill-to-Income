# Women-Skill-to-Income Platform

Women-Skill-to-Income is a full-stack prototype designed to help women
earn income using skills they already have. The platform focuses on
small, practical tasks instead of long-term freelance projects, making
it accessible to homemakers, rural women, and those returning to work
after career breaks.

## What This Platform Does
Many women possess useful skills such as cooking, stitching, tutoring,
basic data entry, or translation, but lack access to safe and flexible
earning opportunities. This platform connects such users with
well-defined, short-duration tasks that match their skills.

The goal is not to compete with large freelancing platforms, but to
create a simpler entry point for first-time digital workers.

## Problem Statement
Traditional online work platforms assume prior experience, confidence,
and digital literacy. For women with limited exposure to online work,
these platforms feel complex and risky.

Common challenges include:
- Difficulty trusting online employers
- Fear of not getting paid
- Lack of resumes or portfolios
- Limited time due to household responsibilities

This project addresses these issues by focusing on simplicity, trust,
and skill-based matching.

## How It Works

### 1. Skill Registration
Users create a simple profile describing what they can do and how much
time they can give. No resume or portfolio is required.

### 2. Task Matching
Requesters post small, clearly defined tasks. The system suggests tasks
based on the user's listed skills.

### 3. Task Completion
Once a task is accepted, the user completes it within the agreed
timeline and submits the result through the platform.

### 4. Payment & Trust
Payments are handled using an escrow-style workflow to ensure fairness.
Funds are released only after task completion is confirmed.

### 5. Reputation Building
Each completed task helps build a work history, enabling access to
better opportunities over time.

## Trust & Safety
Trust is critical, especially for first-time users. The platform
includes:
- Escrow-style payment flow
- Basic identity verification
- Simple dispute resolution
- Clear community guidelines

## How This Is Different from Freelancing Platforms

| Aspect | Traditional Freelancing | Women-Skill-to-Income |
|------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Target users | Experienced professionals | First-time workers |
| Entry barrier | High | Low |
| Work type | Large projects | Small tasks |
| Trust model | Competitive ratings | Payment protection |
| Usability | Assumes digital confidence | Beginner-friendly |

## Technical Overview
- Backend: Node.js with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- API: REST-based architecture
- Testing: Unit and integration tests
- Architecture: Modular and extensible

## Project Status
This is a prototype built to explore system design, backend architecture,
and real-world problem solving. It is not intended for production use
without further security and usability testing.

## Credits
This project is inspired by the open-source initiative
"Economic Queens Tech" and has been refactored and repositioned to focus
specifically on skill-to-income workflows for women.
